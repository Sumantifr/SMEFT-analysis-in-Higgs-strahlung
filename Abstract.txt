Wider research context:

At LHC,  the Higgs boson production is sensitive to a generalized extension of the standard model,  the standard model effective field theory (SM-EFT).  A measurement is proposed to study the SM-EFT operators of mass dimension six involved in the Higgs boson production in association with a vector boson, referred to as VH production,  where the vector boson decays leptonically and the Higgs boson decays to a pair of b quarks.

Objectives:

The objective is to measure the SM-EFT operators,  some of which are accessible for the first time at LHC,  involved in VH production as well as the charge-parity (CP) structure of the H-V interaction in SM-EFT.

Method:

Sensitivity to SM-EFT operators will be measured from the modifications in kinematic distributions,  particularly in the high-energy tail,  using the data collected by the CMS experiment during the LHC Run 2 (2016-2018) and Run 3 (2022-2024), amounting to an integrated luminosity of at least 300/fb. At high energy,  the Higgs boson,  produced with large transverse momentum,  is reconstructed using a single large-radius jet, which will be analyzed using jet substructure techniques.  Complementary angular variables,  unexplored so far in Higgs boson measurements,  will be utilized to access multi-dimensional information of the process and to look for the direct detection of additional sources of CP violation in the Higgs sector.

Level of originality:

Multi-dimensional event information is used to directly probe a large number of SM-EFT operators and,  for the first time,  the SM-EFT effects in CP nature of the H-V coupling.


Primary researchers involved:

The project leader, applicant, and principal investigator (PI) is Dr. Suman Chatterjee. He will spend 100\% of his time on the project.  Dr. Chatterjee is a post-doctoral researcher at the Institute for High Energy Physics (HEPHY) of the Ã–AW. The body of the work will be carried out by a PhD  student under the supervision of the PI.
