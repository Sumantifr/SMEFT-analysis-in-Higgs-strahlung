Wider research context:

At LHC, the Higgs boson production is sensitive to a generalized extension of the standard model, the standard model effective field theory (SM-EFT). A measurement is proposed to study the SM-EFT operators of mass dimension six involved in the Higgs boson production in association with a vector boson, referred to as VH production, where the vector boson decays leptonically and the Higgs boson decays to a pair of b quarks.

Objectives:

The objective is to measure the SM-EFT operators, some of which are accessible for the first time at LHC, involved in VH production as well as the charge-parity (CP) structure of H-V interaction in SM-EFT.

Method:

Sensitivity to SM-EFT operators will be measured from the modifications in kinematic distributions, particularly in the
high-energy tail, using the data collected by the CMS experiment during the LHC Run 2 (2016-2018) and Run 3 (2022-2024), amounting to an integrated luminosity of at least 300/fb.
At high energy, the Higgs boson, produced with large transverse momentum, is reconstructed using a single large-radius jet, which will be analyzed using jet substructure techniques.
Complementary angular variables, unexplored so far in Higgs boson measurements, will be utilized to access multi-dimensional information of the process and to look for the direct detection of additional sources of CP violation in the SM-EFT Higgs sector.

Level of originality:

Multi-dimensional event information is used to directly probe a large number of SM-EFT operators and, for the first time, the SM-EFT effects in CP nature of the H-V coupling.


Primary researchers involved:

The project leader, applicant, and principal investigator (PI) is Dr. Suman Chatterjee. He will spend 50\% of his time on the project. Dr. Chatterjee is a post-doctoral researcher at the Institute for High Energy Physics (HEPHY) of the Ã–AW. The body of the work will be carried out by a Ph.D. student under the supervision of the PI.
